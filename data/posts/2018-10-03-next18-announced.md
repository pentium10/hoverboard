1It is official. Next'18 Extended - Targu Mures is going to take place on **November 8th**.  

**What are Next‘18 Extended Events?**

 Next Extended brings together developer communities around the world to take part in the Next ‘18 experience, either during the conference or even after!

Next Extended allows local developers to access exciting Next ‘18 content and engage with the community through local speakers, activities, and hands-on labs. Google Cloud Next is the I/O equivalent for developers, customers, and other industry partners.

Communities across the globe host external Extended events. Google Developers supports and recognizes GDG and Google Cloud Developer Community chapters that host these events but does not own or manage them.

[IT Mures](/team) got approval to host Next’18 Extended Targu Mures.

**Next’18 Extended - Targu Mures**

Join us for the first Next Extended event in town, where we'll bring together **cloud enthusiasts and the developer community** to be a part of the Next '18 experience.

This year we will be diving deep into cloud with technical sessions, about **VMs, Microservices, Devops, Docker, Kubernetes** and a hands-on codelab on (Kubernetes or Machine Learning TBD) and specialized trainers.

As an attendee, you'll not only be a part of our vibrant cloud community but also **receive free access to Qwiklabs** (a $55+ value) after adding our workshops. 

Don't forget to bring a laptop and get ready for the best Next Extended yet!
